# Jetson and Arduino Integration Guide

## 1. Basic Concepts of Jetson and Arduino

### Jetson
Jetson is a series of embedded computing boards developed by NVIDIA, designed for AI applications and edge computing. It excels at handling tasks such as image recognition, object detection, and real-time data processing, making it ideal for projects requiring high-performance computing on the edge.

## 2. Jetson and Arduino Communication and Integration

### Hardware Communication
Jetson and Arduino can be connected through standard interfaces like **I2C**, **UART**, and **SPI**. These connections enable data exchange between the two devices for efficient control and monitoring. For example, you can connect sensors to Arduino and transmit the sensor data to Jetson for further processing.

### Software Communication
Programming languages like **Python** and **C++** are commonly used to establish communication. For instance, serial communication via USB allows Jetson to send commands to Arduino and receive sensor data back from it. Examples include:

- **Using Python's `pyserial` library** for serial communication.
- **Implementing UART protocols** to exchange data in real-time.

### Example Use Case: Sensor Integration
By connecting sensors such as temperature, humidity, or ultrasonic sensors to Arduino, the data can be collected and transmitted to Jetson for advanced analytics. Jetson can then process the sensor data using AI models or make real-time decisions, such as triggering an alert or controlling an actuator.

This project showcases the integration of **Arduino** with a **CM1106 CO2 sensor** to measure carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. The data collected from the sensor can be transmitted to a Jetson device for further analysis, real-time monitoring, and visualization. This setup is ideal for environmental monitoring, indoor air quality assessment, and industrial applications.

### **Software Setup**

#### Arduino Code
Below is the Arduino code used to interface with the CM1106 sensor, read CO2 levels, and transmit the data.

```cpp
// Code to read CO2 levels from the CM1106 sensor

#include <cm1106_i2c.h> // Library for CM1106 CO2 Sensor

// Initialize the CM1106 I2C object
CM1106_I2C cm1106_i2c;

void setup() {
    // Start I2C communication with the sensor
    cm1106_i2c.begin();
    
    // Start serial communication for data output
    Serial.begin(9600);
    
    // Wait for the sensor to stabilize
    delay(5000);
}

void loop() {
    // Measure CO2 levels
    uint8_t ret = cm1106_i2c.measure_result();

    if (ret == 0) {
        // Successfully read CO2 data
        Serial.print("CO2: ");
        Serial.println(cm1106_i2c.co2); // Print CO2 concentration
    } else {
        // Failed to read data
        Serial.println("Error reading sensor data.");
    }
    
    // Wait 5 seconds before the next reading
    delay(5000);
}
```
